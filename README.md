<p id="description">This project is a simple e-commerce product and cart page built with React and Redux Toolkit. It is designed for developers and learners who want to understand how to manage state effectively in a React application. The product data is fetched from the FakeStore API using React hooks (useEffect useState) and displayed dynamically on the product page. The cart functionality ‚Äî including adding removing increasing and decreasing product quantities ‚Äî is managed using Redux Toolkit for clean scalable state management. Additionally the app uses the react-hot-toast library to show user-friendly toast notifications (e.g. "Product added to cart" "Product removed").</p>
